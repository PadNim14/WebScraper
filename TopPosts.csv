A Goodbye from the Orange Morphsuit Guy,1257,gbhru9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/gbhru9/a_goodbye_from_the_orange_morphsuit_guy/,87,1588367233.0,"Hello Purdue. Today, the last Friday of the semester and last Friday of my undergrad career, is a day I was hoping would go much differently. But, given the circumstances due to COVID-19, this will have to do. For over three years now, I’ve been dancing around campus - sometimes alone, sometimes with a crew - in an orange morphsuit. Some of you love it, some of you hate it. Some of you believe I just do it for attention, but for others it brings a smile to their faces. Regardless, this has been something I have loved doing every week since I’ve donned the suit. It’s fun for me (simply put, I love dancing) and it brings a sense of joy to know that I’ve done something to bring a little extra light and fun into the lives of Purdue students journeying in and out of classes. When I started doing this back in 2017, I had no idea my dancing would grow into a group of over ten fellow morphs. Suffice it to say, I know my legacy is in good hands thanks to them. Anyway, I want to thank all of the people who have supported me and my fellow dancers every Friday for the last few years. Everyone who smiled when we danced by, everyone who gave one of us a high five, everyone who snapped a picture, and everyone who danced along with us. All of you wonderful people are the reason I started doing this and continued to do it for so long. My hope is that this tradition continues for many years to come. It has been an absolute pleasure dancing with you all. To celebrate my last Friday, I will be on campus today with one of the original morphsuit guys from noon-2:00, dancing (and social distancing) around WALC, the Engineering Fountain, and the Memorial Mall. Hope to see some people out there, from 6 feet away of course ;). Boiler Up, Hammer Down, Hail Purdue. Good luck on virtual finals everybody. Happy Friday!!!",2020-07-24 22:46:36
