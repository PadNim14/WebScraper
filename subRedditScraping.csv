I’m an incoming freshman with a very quick question about my housing assignment.

According to a soon-to-be-released study, led by Yale and Harvard researchers, outbreak control would require testing all students every two or three days.",2020-07-22 02:04:13

Message from Dean Hummels (Krannert Dean) regarding fall courses,18,hvfxcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/hvfxcz/message_from_dean_hummels_krannert_dean_regarding/,1,1595394503.0,"I recognize that the below is mainly intended for Krannert students or those taking Krannert courses, but it may provide some insight into how the other colleges will be adapting courses to be in accordance with the Protect Purdue plan.

>To:  Krannert Undergraduate Students

>Most of you have let us know that you want to be on campus.  And we are eager for your return.  But campus this fall will be different from what you have experienced to this point in your pursuit of your Purdue degree.  The reason is that we have pledged to keep our students, staff and faculty as safe as possible without going completely remote.
>
>
>In the next couple of days, you will have your final course schedules for the Fall Semester and most contain some online course offerings.   Why is that?  To protect the health of high-risk instructors, some are teaching with an online format only.  Other faculty teach such large numbers of students, it is not feasible to meet social distancing requirements while being in a classroom.  These courses are available in online format only.  Finally, it was necessary to reserve some teaching capacity to serve students who have opted for a fully online semester. Subject to these constraints our objective is to provide you with the best, and most interactive, residential experience we can.  Of the 81 distinct undergraduate courses offered by Krannert this fall, only seven are totally online.  Of the 190 different sections of Krannert courses, only 35 sections are offered online.   
>
>
>For the courses and sections offered with a residential format, requirements for social distancing in the classroom may not allow all students in a class to physically meet for every class session.  You may be expected to come to class for every scheduled session.  But you also might find that you complete course assignments online on some days and attend class to participate in discussion, teamwork, or case analysis on alternate days.  An example is a course with a TTH power hour schedule. Students may be alphabetically assigned to groups such that half of students come to class on Tuesday and the other half attends in person on Thursday. On the days when you are not meeting in person, you may be completing assignments online or preparing for the upcoming in-person session with readings or case analysis.   Details will be specific to each course and communicated to you by individual faculty.  These pedagogical decisions will be based on the unique nature of that course and our faculty’s best judgement about how to maximize your learning experience.
>
>
>Unfortunately, some of you will find that your final course schedule includes more online courses than you desired, particularly when taking courses across campus.  We encourage you to work with your academic advisor to adjust your schedule to get to something that feels more comfortable for you.   All Krannert majors include multiple UCC choices and many general elective courses.  While an initial choice may be only available online, other options will be available to meet in the classroom.   Be creative, be patient and together we can create the schedule that works best for you.
>
>
>What about the rest of your campus experience?   Faculty are eager to meet with you in office hours to assist your learning.  We have asked them to expand their availability to students this term, but in general these meetings will occur via Zoom.   Student clubs will be active, and are preparing now with the help of Purdue Student Government to maximize the student experience while hewing to the tenants of the Protect Purdue Pledge.   Our case competition community will run a robust lineup of competitions complete with expanded alumni mentoring.   The Krannert Professional Development Center has been working hard to provide expanded access to career coaching.  We anticipate students will find it even easier to connect with great companies for internships and full time positions via our highly effective Virtual Career Fairs.
>
>
>The COVID world requires us all to be resilient in the face of adversity and we have asked our instructors to prepare resilient courses.  These courses will remain highly effective if faculty become ill and someone else needs to take over, if a student needs to take time away from the classroom, or even if we see a repeat of Spring 2020.  All of this design is oriented around the goal of keeping our students, faculty, and staff safe while providing the richest possible residential experience.

>Let us know if you have questions or concerns.  We are ready to listen and work with you to make your Fall 2020 semester the very best that it can be.
